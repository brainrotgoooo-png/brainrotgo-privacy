Privacy Policy for “Brainrot Go”

Last updated: January 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how data is processed when you use the mobile game “Brainrot Go” (“we”, “us”).

1) Who is responsible / Contact
If you have privacy questions, contact:
Email: privacy@YOURDOMAIN.com
(If you don’t have a domain, use a dedicated email account.)

2) What data is processed

2.1 Location data (GPS)
Brainrot Go is a location-based game. With your permission, the app uses your device location to:
- show your position on the in-game map; and
- spawn Brainrots and hotspots near you (for example, generate spawns around your current area).

We do not require location “Always”. You can disable location in iOS/Android settings; the game may not function correctly without it.

Storage: We do not operate our own server that stores your precise location history. Location is used primarily in real time for gameplay. Some data may still be processed by third-party providers used for maps or platform services (see section 3).

2.2 Device / diagnostics information
The app and its underlying platforms may process technical information such as:
- device model, OS version, language/region;
- app performance data, crash logs, diagnostics.

Purpose: to run the app reliably, fix bugs, and improve stability.

2.3 Purchases
If you make an in-app purchase, the purchase is processed by the App Store / Google Play. We do not receive your payment card details. We may receive non-sensitive purchase-related information (e.g., that a purchase was completed) to deliver the purchased item.

2.4 Accounts / direct identifiers
Current version: Brainrot Go does not ask you to create an account inside the app and does not request your name, email, or phone number within the game UI.

If future versions add accounts, cloud save, analytics, ads, or social features, we will update this policy.

3) Third-party services
Brainrot Go uses third-party services that may process data under their own policies:

- Apple App Store / Google Play (distribution, updates, purchases, basic diagnostics)
- Unity (game engine and/or services used by the app)
- Mapbox (maps and location-related features)

These providers may process technical identifiers and diagnostics information to provide their services. For details, see their privacy policies on their official websites.

4) Data sharing
We do not sell your personal data.
We do not share your data for third-party advertising.

However, using the services in section 3 requires data to be processed by those providers to deliver core functionality (e.g., maps, purchases, stability diagnostics).

5) Children
Brainrot Go is designed to be family-friendly.
We do not knowingly collect direct contact information (like name, email, phone number) from children within the app.

If you are a parent/guardian and believe a child has provided personal information to us, contact us and we will take appropriate steps.

6) Retention
We do not maintain our own database of precise location history.
Diagnostics and technical data processed by third-party providers is retained according to their own retention policies.

7) Your choices and rights
- You can withdraw location permission in your device settings.
- Depending on your location, you may have rights such as access, deletion, or objection.
To exercise rights regarding data we control, contact us using the email above.
For data controlled by third-party providers (Apple/Google/Unity/Mapbox), you may need to use their privacy tools or contact them directly.

8) Security
We take reasonable measures to protect data within our control. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

9) Changes
We may update this policy. The latest version will always be available at this URL.
