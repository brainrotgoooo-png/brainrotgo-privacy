Privacy Policy for “Brainrot Go”

Last updated: December 2025

This privacy policy explains what data is processed when you use the mobile game “Brainrot Go”.

1. What data is processed?
1.1 Location data (GPS)

“Brainrot Go” is a location-based game. The app uses your device’s location services to:

show your approximate position on the in-game map,

spawn Brainrots and hotspots around you.

Location data is:

used only for gameplay,

not stored by us on separate servers,

not used to create long-term movement profiles,

not sold or shared with third parties for advertising purposes.

You can disable location access in your device settings at any time. The app may then no longer function correctly.

1.2 Device and usage data

When you download and use the app, certain technical information may be processed automatically, for example:

device model and operating system version,

language and country settings,

crash reports and basic performance data.

This information is mainly processed by platform providers (such as Google Play) and by the game engine / services used by the app. We do not use this data to personally identify you.

1.3 No own analytics / user accounts (current version)

In the current version of “Brainrot Go”:

we do not run our own analytics or tracking system,

we do not create in-app user accounts,

we do not collect names, email addresses or other contact details from players inside the app.

If this changes in future updates (for example, if analytics, cloud saves or account features are added), this privacy policy will be updated accordingly.

2. Third-party services

The app uses the following third-party services:

Google Play – for downloading and updating the app, in-app purchases, and basic crash / usage information.

Unity – as the game engine. Unity may process technical data such as device information and crash reports as part of running the app.

Mapbox – for maps and location-related features.

These providers process data under their own responsibility. For details, please refer to their privacy policies:

Unity Privacy Policy

Mapbox Privacy Policy

Google Privacy Policy

3. Children

“Brainrot Go” is designed to be child-friendly and can be used by children and teenagers.

We do not knowingly collect personal contact information (such as names, email addresses or phone numbers) from children.

If you are a parent or guardian and have questions about data used in connection with this app, or if you believe that personal information has been provided, please contact us using the contact details provided in the app store listing. We will review the request and delete data where applicable.

4. Storage and retention

We do not store personal data on our own servers.

Technical and usage data that is processed by third-party providers (Google, Unity, Mapbox) is stored according to their own retention policies and then deleted or anonymised by them.

5. Your rights

Depending on your country and applicable law, you may have certain rights regarding personal data, for example:

right of access (information about data processed about you),

right to rectification,

right to erasure,

right to restriction of processing,

right to object to certain processing.

You can exercise these rights by contacting us via the contact information provided in the app store listing. For data processed directly by Google, Unity or Mapbox, you may also need to contact these providers or use the privacy settings in your Google account / on your device.

6. Changes to this privacy policy

This policy may be updated from time to time, for example if:

new features are added to the app,

additional services or analytics tools are integrated,

legal requirements change.

The latest version will always be available at this URL and in the app’s store listing.
