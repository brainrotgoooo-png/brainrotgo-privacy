<h1>Privacy Policy for “Brainrot Go”</h1>
<p><em>Last updated: January 2026</em></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains how data is processed when you use the mobile game “Brainrot Go” (“we”, “us”).</p>

<h2>1) Who is responsible / Contact</h2>
<p>If you have privacy questions, want to exercise your rights, or need support, contact:<br>
Email: <a href="mailto:brainrotgoooo@gmail.com">brainrotgoooo@gmail.com</a></p>

<h2>2) What data is processed</h2>

<h3>2.1 Location data (GPS)</h3>
<p>Brainrot Go is a location-based game. With your permission, the app uses your device location to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>show your position on the in-game map; and</li>
  <li>spawn Brainrots and hotspots near you (for example, generate spawns around your current area).</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not require location “Always”. You can disable location in iOS/Android settings; the game may not function correctly without it.</p>
<p><strong>Storage:</strong> We do not operate our own server that stores your precise location history. Location is used primarily in real time for gameplay. Some data may still be processed by third-party providers used for maps or platform services (see section 3).</p>

<h3>2.2 Device / diagnostics information</h3>
<ul>
  <li>device model, OS version, language/region;</li>
  <li>app performance data, crash logs, diagnostics.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> to run the app reliably, fix bugs, and improve stability.</p>

<h3>2.3 Purchases</h3>
<p>If you make an in-app purchase, the purchase is processed by the App Store / Google Play. We do not receive your payment card details. We may receive non-sensitive purchase-related information (e.g., that a purchase was completed) to deliver the purchased item.</p>

<h3>2.4 Accounts / direct identifiers</h3>
<p>Current version: Brainrot Go does not ask you to create an account inside the app and does not request your name, email, or phone number within the game UI.</p>
<p>If future versions add accounts, cloud save, analytics, ads, or social features, we will update this policy.</p>

<h2>3) Third-party services</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Apple App Store / Google Play (distribution, updates, purchases, basic diagnostics)</li>
  <li>Unity (game engine and/or services used by the app)</li>
  <li>Mapbox (maps and location-related features)</li>
</ul>
<p>These providers may process technical identifiers and diagnostics information to provide their services. For details, see their privacy policies on their official websites.</p>

<h2>4) Data sharing</h2>
<p>We do not sell your personal data. We do not share your data for third-party advertising.</p>
<p>However, using the services in section 3 requires data to be processed by those providers to deliver core functionality (e.g., maps, purchases, stability diagnostics).</p>

<h2>5) Children</h2>
<p>Brainrot Go is designed to be family-friendly. We do not knowingly collect direct contact information (like name, email, phone number) from children within the app.</p>
<p>If you are a parent/guardian and believe a child has provided personal information to us, contact us and we will take appropriate steps.</p>

<h2>6) Retention</h2>
<p>We do not maintain our own database of precise location history. Diagnostics and technical data processed by third-party providers is retained according to their own retention policies.</p>

<h2>7) Your choices and rights</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You can withdraw location permission in your device settings.</li>
  <li>Depending on your location, you may have rights such as access, deletion, or objection.</li>
</ul>
<p>To exercise rights regarding data we control, contact us using the email above. For data controlled by third-party providers (Apple/Google/Unity/Mapbox), you may need to use their privacy tools or contact them directly.</p>

<h2>8) Security</h2>
<p>We take reasonable measures to protect data within our control. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

<h2>9) Changes</h2>
<p>We may update this policy. The latest version will always be available at this URL.</p>
